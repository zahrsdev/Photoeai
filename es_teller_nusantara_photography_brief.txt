### Enhanced Brief: Award-Winning Product Photography for Es Teller Nusantara

---

#### **1. Main Subject: Hero Shot of Es Teller Nusantara**
- **Product Details:**  
  Showcase Es Teller Nusantara in a tall, crystal-clear glass that captures the layers of vibrant tropical ingredients—coconut, avocado, jackfruit, shaved ice, and condensed milk—each ingredient meticulously arranged to highlight its texture and freshness. Add realistic condensation and micro-particles of shaved ice clinging to the glass, emphasizing the drink's icy chill and refreshing nature. The surface of the drink will feature a delicate garnish—a slice of jackfruit and a sprig of mint—to crown the composition with elegance.

- **Storytelling Element:**  
  The image tells the story of tropical indulgence, evoking the feeling of a serene escape to an Indonesian paradise. The drink is presented as the ultimate symbol of refreshment after a day of exploring lush jungles and vibrant markets. The environment subtly reinforces this narrative, transporting the viewer to a tropical haven.

#### **2. Composition and Framing**
- **Shot Type:** Eye-level shot to create an approachable and intimate perspective, inviting the viewer to "reach out" and take the drink.  
- **Framing:** Medium shot with a slight forward tilt to create subtle dynamism, enhancing the visual pull toward the product.  

- **Compositional Rule:**  
  The Rule of Thirds is applied strategically, with the glass positioned slightly off-center to the right. Supporting props and environmental features occupy the left third, creating a balanced yet engaging frame.

- **Negative Space:**  
  Balanced negative space is achieved in the background, emphasizing the hero product while allowing room for complementary details and texture.

- **Dynamic Composition:**  
  Incorporate floating elements, such as translucent ice cubes and slices of avocado and jackfruit subtly suspended mid-air above the drink. This creates a sense of motion and wonder, adding stopping power to the visual.

---

#### **3. Lighting and Atmosphere**
- **Lighting Style:** Bright tropical glow, mimicking the soft, radiant light of a sunny day in the tropics.  

- **Key Lighting:**  
  A single-source diffused light positioned at a 45-degree angle from the front-left ensures even illumination across the glass and ingredients while creating soft highlights that accentuate the vibrant colors and textures.

- **Fill Lighting:**  
  Subtle fill light from the right balances shadows without flattening the image, maintaining depth and contrast.  

- **Rim Lighting:**  
  A delicate rim light from behind the glass highlights the edges, creating separation between the product and the background, while emphasizing the translucency of the glass and the sheen of the ingredients.  

- **Mood:**  
  Fresh, vibrant, and uplifting, with an added touch of serene luxury that transports the viewer to a lush, tropical environment.

- **Stopping Power Enhancements:**  
  Incorporate glowing motes of light in the background, reminiscent of sunlight filtering through palm leaves. A dramatic yet controlled splash of liquid can cascade outward from the glass, hinting at the dynamic energy of the drink's preparation.

#### **4. Background and Setting**
- **Environment:**  
  The drink is set on a rustic wooden surface, subtly weathered to evoke the charm of an Indonesian beachside café. The background features blurred tropical foliage, such as palm leaves and banana plants, enhancing the sensory storytelling without overpowering the product.

- **Color Palette:**  
  Dominated by earthy greens, warm browns, and pristine whites, accentuated by pops of vibrant yellow (jackfruit) and creamy hues from the condensed milk. This tropical palette harmonizes with the drink’s natural ingredients.

- **Supporting Props:**  
  Carefully chosen props include faintly misted ice cubes scattered on the wooden surface, droplets of water sliding down the glass, and a few deconstructed elements of the drink—fresh coconut shavings, an avocado slice, and jackfruit pieces—placed in the foreground and background for depth and context.

- **Sensory Enhancements:**  
  Add wisps of vapor curling subtly from the shaved ice to evoke a frosty chill. Water droplets on the glass will be hyper-detailed, with light refracting through them to enhance realism.

#### **5. Camera and Lens Simulation**
- **Camera:** Canon EOS R5  
- **Lens:** 50mm f/1.8 for a natural perspective and creamy bokeh.  

- **Updated Settings:**  
  - Aperture: f/2.2 (slightly wider for increased light and smoother background separation).  
  - Shutter Speed: 1/160s (to crisply capture dynamic elements like floating ice cubes and liquid splash).  
  - ISO: 100 (maintain noise-free clarity).  

- **Technical Precision Enhancements:**  
  Focus-stacking technique to ensure infinite sharpness across the glass and ingredients, while maintaining a soft blur in the background. Utilize tethered shooting for precise adjustments and real-time feedback.

---

#### **6. Stylistic Qualifiers**
- **Style:** Ultra-detailed professional product photography with a hyper-realistic, editorial flair.  
- **Aesthetics:** 8K resolution with razor-sharp focus, professional color grading that enhances the natural vibrancy of the ingredients, and dynamic visual elements that captivate.  

- **Inspired By:**  
  The lush, immersive imagery of tropical beverage advertising and the intricate detail work seen in high-end food photography.

The tropical narrative immerses the viewer in an aspirational escape, while the balanced composition and lighting techniques ensure the product is both the visual and emotional hero of the shot. Dynamic elements like floating ice cubes and glowing motes of light add stopping power, while sensory cues such as realistic condensation and wisps of vapor evoke texture and temperature. The result is a photograph that doesn’t just showcase Es Teller Nusantara—it transports the viewer, creating an irresistible visual experience that aligns with award-winning standards.
