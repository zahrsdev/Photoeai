  - **Fill Light:** Diffused fill light on the opposite side to subtly soften shadows on the jar while maintaining depth.
  - **Rim Light:** A subtle rim light placed behind and slightly below the jar to create a luminous halo effect, separating the product from the background and enhancing the luxurious mood.

- **Color Palette:** Dominated by black, silver, and blue-gray tones, with subtle green accents from the fresh leaves and hints of brown from the volcanic rocks and scattered coffee beans. A soft gradient backdrop transitions from deep charcoal at the bottom to a misty blue-gray at the top, adding depth and visual interest.
- **Supporting Props:** 
  - **Volcanic Rocks:** Rugged, dark volcanic rocks arranged asymmetrically around the jar, suggesting purity and strength derived from the Earth's raw elements.
