## üöÄ Quality Improvements

### Before Enhancement:
```
Original: "A bottle of water on a table with soft lighting"
Enhancement: "make it more luxurious"
Result: "A bottle of water on a table with soft lighting. **CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT:** make it more luxurious"
```

### After Enhancement:
```
Original: "A bottle of water on a table with soft lighting"
Enhancement: "make it more luxurious" 
Result: "A premium glass water bottle meticulously placed on a polished dark wood table, its sleek contours accented by expertly controlled studio lighting. Soft, diffused illumination from a high-end octabox creates delicate gradient highlights that shimmer across the bottle's surface, emphasizing its pristine clarity and luxurious design..."
```
